## Beta
Fisherman is currently in BETA, meaning:
 - Untested Multiplayer compatibility
 - Unfinished Assets 
 - Missing Content 
 - **Bugs**

If you would like to report a bug with Fisherman, Please visit the [Fisherman Discord's bug-report Channel](https://discord.gg/Ctt68SuwZQ)

## Compatibility
 - If you are a filthy autosprint user, Fisherman's Primary will not work with RTAutoSprintEx or autosprint via Aerolt. **.score's alternative [AutoSprint](https://thunderstore.io/package/score/AutoSprint/) mod does works.**
 - The Custom UI element for Fisherman's Utility does not work properly with RiskUI, and may not work with other HUD mods.
